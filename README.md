# Settlers 4 Build Configurator

A small project to calculate the amount of buildings you need to fulfill your T3 unit supply chain for the game Settlers 4.

For simplicity, this project only features the Roman race.

This project is hosted with Github pages. You can find it [here](https://sir-hennihau.github.io/Settlers-4-Build-Configurator/).
